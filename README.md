# Tonalizer - CRF-based tone reconstitution (or diacritization) tool

Introduction
	In many languages such as Bambara or Arabic, tone markers (diacritics) may be written but are actually often omitted. Lack of tone markers contributer to ambiguities and subsequent difficulties when reading texts. To circumvent this problem, tonalization may be used, as a word sense disambiguation task, relying on context to add diacritics that partially disambiguate words as well as senses.
